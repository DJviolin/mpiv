A fork of [MPIV](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/404-mouseover-popup-image-viewer/) (Mouseover Popup Image Viewer).
 
 * Mostly just reformatted to improve maintainability by conforming to common JS norms and ES2015+ syntax so it can't run in ancient browser anymore.
 * Fixed a couple of bugs that I personally encountered.
 * ShadowDOM support added for sites built with Web Components e.g. Polymer.
